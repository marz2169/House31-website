        "details": "This task involves enhancing the UI system with modern design patterns and implementing a theme switching capability:\n\n1. **Theme Provider Implementation**:\n   - Create a ThemeProvider component using React Context API to manage theme state\n   - Define theme constants for both light and dark modes (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)\n   - Store theme preference in localStorage to persist user selection\n   - Add system preference detection using `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`\n\n2. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle Component**:\n   - Build a reusable Toggle component with appropriate styling\n   - Position the toggle in the site header for easy access\n   - Add appropriate icons (sun/moon) to indicate current theme\n   - Implement accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes)\n\n3. **Consistent Styling Across Components**:\n   - Refactor existing components to use theme variables instead of hardcoded values\n   - Update Tailwind configuration to support theme switching:\n     ```js\n     // tailwind.config.js example\n     module.exports = {\n       darkMode: 'class',\n       theme: {\n         extend: {\n           colors: {\n             // Define theme colors that will change based on mode\n             primary: 'var(--color-primary)',\n             secondary: 'var(--color-secondary)',\n             // etc.\n           }\n         }\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n   - Create CSS variables for both themes:\n     ```css\n     :root {\n       --color-primary: #3b82f6;\n       --color-secondary: #10b981;\n       --text-primary: #111827;\n       --bg-primary: #ffffff;\n       /* etc. */\n     }\n     \n     .dark {\n       --color-primary: #60a5fa;\n       --color-secondary: #34d399;\n       --text-primary: #f9fafb;\n       --bg-primary: #111827;\n       /* etc. */\n     }\n     ```\n   - Ensure all shadcn/ui components properly support theme switching\n\n4. **Theme Transition Effects**:\n   - Add CSS transitions for smooth theme changes:\n     ```css\n     * {\n       transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease, border-color 0.3s ease;\n     }\n     ```\n   - Optimize transitions to prevent performance issues (limit to color properties)\n   - Test and adjust transition timing for optimal user experience\n\n5. **Integration with Existing Components**:\n   - Update all page layouts and components to properly use theme variables\n   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility in both themes\n   - Test all UI components in both light and dark modes",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Theme Provider Testing**:\n   - Verify theme state is correctly managed and persisted in localStorage\n   - Test system preference detection works correctly\n   - Ensure theme context is properly accessible throughout the component tree\n\n2. **Toggle Component Testing**:\n   - Verify toggle UI renders correctly in both themes\n   - Test toggle interaction (click, keyboard) properly switches themes\n   - Confirm appropriate aria attributes are present for accessibility\n   - Test that toggle state reflects the current theme\n\n3. **Styling Consistency Testing**:\n   - Create a visual test suite comparing all components in both themes\n   - Verify all components maintain proper contrast ratios in both themes\n   - Check that no hardcoded color values remain in the codebase\n   - Test responsive behavior in both themes across different screen sizes\n\n4. **Transition Testing**:\n   - Measure and optimize transition performance (should be under 100ms)\n   - Verify transitions appear smooth on various devices and browsers\n   - Test that no UI elements \"flash\" or display incorrectly during transition\n   - Ensure transitions don't cause layout shifts\n\n5. **Integration Testing**:\n   - Test theme switching on all major pages and components\n   - Verify theme preference persists across page navigation\n   - Test initial load with both system preference and saved preference\n   - Conduct user testing to gather feedback on theme implementation",
